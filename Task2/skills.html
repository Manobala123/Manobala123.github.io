<p style="margin-left:5% ;margin-right:5%;">• Computer science majors offer an understanding of computing technology and the ability to understand and study complex problems in technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;Computing technology is a crucial part of robotics.<br>
• Computer scientists understand the robotic software platforms and are necessary for researching high-level programming.<br>
• While mechanical and electrical engineers focus on the hardware aspects of robotics, computer scientists work on the programming side. Computer &nbsp;&nbsp;scientists design what has been called "the brain" of the robots. The brain dictates how the robot will interpret the world, its movement and its &nbsp;&nbsp;actions.<br>
• Computer scientists deal with the motion planning, computer vision and machine learning aspects of robot creation. A lot of computer science&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;courses include topics like artificial intelligence and software design. Some even say a background in psychology can help with the computer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;science  aspect of robotics.<br>

<font size="5"face="Arial Narrow"><i>

<p style="margin-left:5% ;margin-right:5%;">• Mechanical engineering is another branch of engineering that helps with an aspect of robotics technology. Mechanical engineers work to design and  &nbsp; develop, build and test mechanical sensors and devices.<br>
• In the robotics field, mechanical engineers would be in charge of the physical make-up of a robot. Mechanical engineering courses like, mechanics, &nbsp;&nbsp;materials engineering and manufacturing are central to understanding how robotics works.<br>

• In addition to mechanics, materials engineering and manufacturing courses, many mechanical engineering courses offer specializations in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;mechatronics or robotics that allow students to focus on the physical design and actuation of a robot.<br>

• Those who earn an associate's degree might become an electro-mechanical technician. In this role, you can operate, test and maintain automated &nbsp;&nbsp;and robotic equipment. There are many other related positions an individual with their associate's degree can fill, including that of a mechanical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;engineering technician, industrial engineering technician and mechanical drafter.</p>

<font size="5"face="Arial Narrow"><i>

<p style="margin-left:5% ;margin-right:5%;">• Electrical engineering is one of the best majors to have in college to help pursue a career in robotics. Electrical engineering classes include general &nbsp;&nbsp;training courses in pneumatics and hydraulics, numerically controlled systems, integrated systems, logic and microprocessors.<br>
• Robotics relies heavily on the knowledge of engineers who specialize in electrical engineering, particularly for the electronics, embedded systems, &nbsp;&nbsp;control theory and low-level programming.<br>
• Electrical engineering courses provide a lot of information about robotics and automation and can provide suitable preparation for&nbsp; aspiring robotics &nbsp; engineers.</p>
